# Echo Sense Todo / Wishlist

* Stagger scheduling of sensor process tasks so that multiple sensors (with same associated process task) receiving data in the same period don't schedule processing for the same second
* Upgrade to alt 0.18
* Upgrade to React Router 2.0
* Rollbar for client-side error notifications
* Add sensortype to Analysis() for cleaner type-specific reporting
* Ability to export to CSV analysis viewed in analysis history (client-side?)
* Support for standard hardware protocols
* Device templates for quick setup of standard sensor hardware
